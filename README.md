### A better tool for crayoners

I'm someone who likes to draw my own maps of what transit _could_ be. Most people (including myself) use Google MyMaps for this, but MyMaps is old, hasn't been updated recently and lacks of a lot of features that would be useful to people like me.
I'm creating a tool built specially for people like me, which will allow users to draw lines on a map with perfect curves, proper geospatial (3D) alignment data, rolling stock/service type-constraints and more.
If you're interested in the project and want to know more or have a feature request, please check out [this thread](https://twitter.com/43Masonic/status/1549526841681010688?s=20&t=4PNmiWmRHbKslRBWtMN3DQ).

**Tools used**: Mapbox-GL, NextJS, React, JavaScript, GeoJSON

**Skills**: programming, product design, user outreach
